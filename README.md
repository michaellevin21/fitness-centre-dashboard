Steps to Run Code:
1. Download zip file of repo and extract contents
2. Edit the database.ini file and add the name of the database you want to store the students in, your pgAdmin username, and your pgAdmin password(no quotation marks on anything)
3. Run the create-database and sample-data SQL files in the pgAdmin query tool
4. Type python main.py in the terminal after navigating to the project directory

PS: These instructions only work if you have installed PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and the Config-parser and Psycopg librarys
