To run this code first put all of the files in the same directory then edit the database.ini file and add the name of the database you want to store the students in, your pgadmin username, and your pgadmin password(no quotation marks on anything). After that just type python main.py in the terminal after navigating to the project directory. PS: you must install configparser and psycopg2 for this code to work.
